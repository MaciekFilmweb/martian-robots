# Martian Robots

Creating this app is a recruitment task. The details can be found in attached "coding challenge.pdf" file.

To run the code you need to have Java 8 installed. 

Execute "run.bat" or "run.sh" file from the project root directory.

When the app is running open your browser and go to localhost:8080. You can paste your robot instructions there.

The app is still missing some features like logging or input validation.

It was created using Eclipse Mars, of course.
