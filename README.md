# Martian Robots

This project was created as a recruitment task, which details can be found in attached "coding challenge.pdf" file.

To run the code you need to have Java 8 installed. 

Execute "run.bat" file from the project root directory. If you are on Linux perform analogous steps as in the file.

When the app is running open your browser and go to localhost:8080. You can paste your robot instructions there.

The app is still missing some features like logging or input validation.

It was created using Eclipse Mars, of course.
